    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a super-chocolaty Italian-style ice cream - gelato; use the best ingredients possible, because it really makes a difference. I use 70% chocolate for it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2¼ cups whole milk</li>
        <li>⅝ cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped dark chocolate</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk, 1/2 the sugar, and cream in a heavy saucepan until simmering and sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes, being careful not to scorch the milk. Remove milk from heat and whisk in cocoa powder and dark chocolate. Allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and remaining sugar in a large bowl using a whisk or electric beater until thick and pale yellow. Add about 1 cup of the slightly cooled chocolate mixture in a slow stream to avoid cooking eggs, whisking constantly until well combined. Add the rest of the chocolate mixture and return to the saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir constantly until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Strain custard through a sieve into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap touching to mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour cold custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until hardened, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
